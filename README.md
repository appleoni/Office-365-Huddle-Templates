## Foreword

This document will guide you to deploy the solution to your environment.

First, an Azure AAD is required to register the app registrations. In this document, the Azure AAD will be called "Huddle AAD", and an account in Huddle AAD will be called Huddle work account.

* All app registrations should be created in the Huddle AAD. 
* Bot/Luis/Microsoft App should be registered with a Huddle work account.


* SharePoint lists should be created on SharePoint associating with Huddle AAD.

* Following Powershell Modules are installed
   * [MicrosoftTeams](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MicrosoftTeams)
   * [ImportExcel](https://github.com/dfinke/ImportExcel)
   * [Microsoft.Graph](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-powershell)
   * [SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets?view=sharepoint-ps)
   * [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-az-ps)

   > Notes: 
   >
   > Run PowerShell as Administrator, and execute the commands below to install required modules:
   > ```powershell
   > Install-Module MicrosoftTeams
   > Install-Module ImportExcel
   > Install-module Microsoft.Graph
   > Install-Module SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline
   > Install-Module Az
   > ```
   >

* Required [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your local environment. Node.js >= 8.5 and npm installed on your machine, then use:
```cmd
npm install -g luis-apis
```

An Azure Subscription is required to deploy the Azure components. We will use the [ARM Template](azuredeploy.json) to deploy these Azure components automatically. 

Please download files in `/Files` folder to your computer.

To learn more about the huddle solutions in Microsoft Teams and Microsoft O365, visit the [Microsoft developer blog](https://dev.office.com/blogs/new-templates-to-create-huddle-solutions-in-microsoft-teams-and-office-365).

## Enable and Create Microsoft Teams

### Enable Microsoft Teams feature

Please follow [Teams org-wide settings in the Microsoft Teams admin center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/enable-features-office-365#teams-org-wide-settings-in-the-microsoft-teams-admin-center).

Make sure the following options are turned on:

* Allow third-party apps

* Allow interaction with custom apps

  ![](Images/ms-teams-configure.png)

### Create Teams

In this section, we will connect to Microsoft Teams in PowerShell with a Huddle AAD account, and execute some PowerShell scripts to create teams from an Excel file.

> Note: after you finish this section, teams will be created right away. But their owners and members will take up to an hour to show in Teams. Refer to [Add-TeamUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/teams/add-teamuser?view=teams-ps) for more details.

1. First, let open and edit `/Files/Teams.xlsx`. Input the teams and related information.

   > Note: 
   >
   > * AccessType:
   >   * Private: Private teams can only be joined if the team owner adds you to them. They also won't show up in your teams gallery.
   >   * Public: public teams are visible to everyone from the teams gallery and you can join them without getting approval from the team owner.
   > * Owners and Members:
   >   * Please use UPN (User Principle Name) instead of email.
   >   * Use ";" to separate multi-users. 
   >   * The Huddle work account used to connect to Microsoft Teams will be added as the owner of each team automatically, no matter it is in the owners column or not.

2. Open PowerShell Console

3. Navigate to the `/Files` folder in PowerShell

   ```powershell
   cd <Path to Files folder> # For example: cd "c:\Users\Admin\Desktop\Huddle\Files\"
   ```

4. Connect to Microsoft Teams with a Huddle AAD account.

   ```
   $connection = Connect-MicrosoftTeams
   ```

5. Execute the commands below which reads data from the Excel file and create teams:

   ```powershell
   .\NewTeams.ps1 -excelPath .\Teams.xlsx
   ```

### Update Each Team

For each team you created, please active the default planer and create 4 buckets:

1. Open <https://www.office.com>, sign in.

   ![](Images/ms-planner-01.png)

   Click **Planner**.

   Find the planner which has the same name as the team, then click it.

   ![](Images/ms-planner-02.png)

   ```
3. Run the following script in the PowerShell console. This script will create a resource group in Azure, then import, train, and publish LUIS App. Replace \<resource group name\> with the resource group name you expect. If the execution is successful, LUIS App Id and LUIS App Key will be returned. Remember these two values

   ```PowerShell
   #Replace <resource group name> with the resource group name you expect.
   .\DeployLuis.ps1 -appPath .\LUISApp.json -resourceGroup <resource group name>
   ```
